# Ultra Fast Cloud Based IDE

## 🚀 Overview
**Ultra Fast Cloud Based IDE** is the next evolution in cloud-based development environments, designed to be **100x faster than Replit** with extreme performance, scalability, and real-time collaboration. Built using **Rust, Go, and Python for AI/ML**, this IDE will redefine how developers write, test, and deploy code in the cloud.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **⚡ Unmatched Performance**: Leverages WebAssembly (WASM), WebGL and CRDTs for **ultra-low latency** coding.
- **🖥️ Next-Gen IDE**: Zed-like ultra-fast editing experience with **Tree-sitter-powered syntax awareness**.
- **🌍 Distributed & Edge-First**: Cloudflare Workers + Fly.io + Firecracker VMs for **instant global execution**.
- **🧠 AI-Driven Coding Assistance**: AI-powered autocomplete, bug detection, and smart refactoring (Rust + PyTorch).
- **📡 Real-Time Collaboration**: CRDT-based collaborative editing (WebRTC + Phoenix LiveView for seamless sync).
- **🚀 Frictionless Deployment**: Automatic scaling, cloud execution, and **blazing-fast startup times**.
- **💾 Multi-Language Support**: Fully optimized for **Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Elixir, and more**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
### **Backend:**
- **Rust** (Core runtime & WASM execution)
- **Go** (High-performance execution & microservices)
- **Python** (AI-powered coding assistance & ML integrations)
- **Firecracker VMs** (Lightning-fast containerized execution)
- **Cloudflare Workers + Fly.io** (Ultra-low latency execution)

### **Frontend:**
